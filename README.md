# Friction
Friction is a fast paced 2D side scrolling shooter. The player is dropped into a random world with enemies. The goal is to pick up rare items during play to then sell for coin at the end of each stage. Each stage is timed. If the player does not reach the end of the stage in time, they lose and restart, otherwise they progress stages. The catch is that the player can only hold a certain amount of items in their inventory. The loot has a tier system, higher tier loot pays more, however they also weigh more. Your player will be weighed down by the loot they carry resulting in slower movement, you must stratigize your loot for maximum speed and profit. There are items that boost the player such as running shoes that will increase their speed.
